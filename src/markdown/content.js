  "about-me": `**Hello world!** And welcome to my portfolio website.
    </br></br>
    I’m Sam, a full stack software engineer who loves nothing better than getting my hands dirty and building stuff. Whether that's a dashboard, landing page, web scraper or a scalable serverless distributed system, I love the challenge of solving complex problems.
    <br/><br/>
    As a full stack software engineer, I strive to bridge the gap between the front-end and back-end realms. I enjoy working with both sides of the development process, from designing captivating user interfaces to architecting robust and scalable systems. I aim to create seamless experiences that leave a lasting impression on users (and not have them raging about bugs).
    <br/><br/>
    Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in digital marketing and had a keen interest in SEO (search engine optimisation) and content marketing. But after spending countless hours fixing technical SEO issues (cumulative layout shifts, time-to-first-byte delays, server-side redirects) I finally took the plunge into becoming a professional software engineer.
    <br/><br/>
    The journey hasn’t been easy. With nothing more than a B in GCSE ICT, I’ve self-taught myself almost everything I know. Thankfully I’m too persistent to quit and I can’t imagine myself in any other career.

  interests: `All my life I’ve been interested in computers and programming. But I didn’t think someone would ever pay me money to do it professionally. Luckily, it turns out that there are someone people out there who believe in me.
    <br/><br/>
    When it comes to languages and frameworks my current interests are in the JavaScript / TypeScript ecosystem which includes React, Next.js, Bun and Node.js.
    <br/><br/>
    Aside from my interest in computers, I’m also an avid movie watcher and a big fan of anything by Chris Nolan. Before you ask, yes my favourite film is Inception. But controversially I don't think it's the best movie ever.
    <br/><br/>
    Another area of interest which I’m very passionate about is SEO and entrepreneurship. I’ve built many affiliate websites over the years ranging from success to _great success_. But no matter how many websites I make, there’s a huge sense of achievement when you reach that number one spot on Google.
    `,
  experience: `Over the years I’ve had experience with several languages, frameworks and libraries.
    <br/><br/>
    From the front-end side, my main experience is in React and all of its corresponding frameworks/libraries. I originally started building websites with create react app but quickly advanced to Gatsby as it was all the rage at the time. In recent months I’ve found myself repeatedly using Next.js due to its server-side rending abilities which I think is fantastic.
    <br/><br/>
    I currently work for a SaaS company called Lunio and have been there since its inception (although I didn't start out as a software engineer). During my time there I’ve worked on all aspects of the product from migrating the legacy Vue dashboard to React and migrating the legacy PHP API to Python.
    <br/><br/>
    As a full stack engineer, I’ve also ventured into various cloud realms including CI/CD with GitHub actions and a bit of Terraform. I’ve also spent most of my time using AWS while monitoring logs on DataDog.
