## My Portfolio Website 

![portfolio website cover image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenryk/portfolio-website/main/public/assets/images/portfolio-homepage.jpg)

This website was built by me [@lenryk](https://github.com/lenryk) from the ground up using Next.js and Tailwind.

Although I built this website myself, I didn’t design it. The design for this website came from the Figma community by the user [@darelova](https://www.figma.com/@darelova).

>Pro Tip: You can find plenty of free community designs for websites and new projects on the [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community)

I tweaked the design for my own needs, but the main inspiration came from [@darelova](https://www.figma.com/@darelova) and their great work. So hats off to you, and I hope you design many more cool layouts in the future!

## FAQ

### Why Next.js?

Mainly for serverside rendering (SSR) and its built-in page router.

### Why Tailwind?

Originally I was going to use Styled Components but since it’s not supported for SSR in Next.js 13 I switched to Tailwind.

### Can I use this for my own site?

Sure - would love it if you could give me a mention or shout-out.

### How did you make that cool face from text?

I manually changed the colour of every letter until it resembled my face...

Just kidding! It uses a background image clip CSS property that sets the colours on the text. Just make sure you have an image with a transparent background for the best results.

### How do I run this locally?

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Open `localhost:3000`

### How long did it take to build?

The main site and responsiveness design took around 4 days of work but then there were plenty of little tweaks and animations I worked in after. 

Even now it's still an ongoing project and will probably never be truly “finished”.
